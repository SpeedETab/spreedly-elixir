**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add spreedly_elixir to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:spreedly_elixir, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure spreedly_elixir is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:spreedly_elixir]]
        end
